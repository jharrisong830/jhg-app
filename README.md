# jhg.app

This is the new home of my portfolio site ([current repo](https://github.com/jharrisong830/jhg_app), [published site](https://jhg.app)).

My current site is the result of my experiments with web development without knowing anything formally (with some remnants from my even older site, which was just pure html/css). I'm re-building it with React and Next.js, now that I have covered web development fundamentals in my coursework.

This site is **not** published yet. My [old site](https://jhg.app) remains up until this is finished.
